```
cp .env.example server/.env
```

2. Create and activate a new virtual environment for the server

**MacOS / Unix**

```
cd server
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```
cd server
python3 -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\activate.bat
```

3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## FAQ

Q: Why did you pick these frameworks?

A: We chose the most minimal framework to convey the key Stripe calls and
concepts you need to understand. These demos are meant as an educational tool
that helps you roadmap how to integrate Stripe within your own system
independent of the framework.
